# C++ Graphics Engine
A small graphics engine developed in Visual Studio based on C++.
Developed using the SDL2, GLM libraries, and a simplified version of OpenGL.

## Structure
Being created in Visual Studio 2022, the engine is divided into 2 projects.

### Engine
This part is where the libraries and the entire basic structure of the engine are managed.

### Demo
In this part, the **engine** can be called to build the project to be developed on this base.
The current version is a simple prototype that can be adjusted to whatever you want to create.
